**1. Please be so nice and attach error traces and code snippets.**<br>
If someone comes and tells us, he has error *xy* in his project, we always need to ask for logs, error traces / messages and parts of the code to identify and understand your problem. You can upload such stuff on websites like [Codeshare.io](https://codeshare.io) or [hastebin](https://hastebin.com) for free or put your source code in a github repository that we can overview the whole project to analyse error sources and maybe sending pull requests as solutions.
<br>

**2. Never send errors, code parts or something like this in screenshots.**<br>
Sometimes, also supporters, need to search in the internet or try something on their own machines, so it can be verry unuseful if you send a non-copyable picture of your stuff.
<br>

**3. Please, try to use google before asking :)**<br>
Really, not meant it badly, but sometimes, we get questions, which you can answer with 10 seconds of googling. That costs only time and nerves. If you cant find anything, try to optimize your search behaviour. For coding questions, I can only recommend don't using google. A good search engine for stuff like that is [duckduckgo](https://duckduckgo.com), or, as my mates at work told me, if you are searching for .NET or Microsoft specific topics, use [bing](https://www.bing.com/). Really, it works way better with such stuff than google does.
Also, try to use keywords while searching like `"java parse json from url"` or `"discord.py python server usage"`. Then you can look on pages like [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com) or take a look in the official documentation of API's or Frameworks (Microsoft has [really good docs](https://msdn.microsoft.com/de-de/library/) for C# coding, for example).

**4. Please, be patient and nice.**<br>
Also Supporters, Moderators and Admins have a reallife. So please be patient and don't be annoying when nobody answers instanly on your question. If you mention us correctly or sending your question via DM, we will get notice about it and will answer as soon as possible. :)
